Go DDP Client
=============

A golang ddp client for meteor

Still under development, most features missing, for now:

1. Can connect to remote host and get session id
2. Ping-Pong works

Development checklist:

1. Subscribe/Unsubscribe, handling of client side collections
2. Login/Logout
3. Method call
